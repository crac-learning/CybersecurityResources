## üåü Introduction

Web applications are a primary target for attackers due to their widespread use and accessibility. Securing web applications involves understanding potential vulnerabilities, implementing robust security measures, and staying updated with the latest threats and tools.

## üîë Key Concepts

1. **OWASP Top 10**
   - A list of the top 10 critical security risks to web applications.
   - [Learn more](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Ensuring users are who they claim to be and restricting access based on roles.

3. **Secure Data Transmission**
   - Use HTTPS and secure protocols to protect data in transit.

4. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - Prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.

5. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Follow guidelines to minimize security risks during development.
