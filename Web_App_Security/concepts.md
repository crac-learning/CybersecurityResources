## üõ° OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and security professionals. It highlights the most critical security risks to web applications.

### Key Risks:
1. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfigurations
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

## üîë Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication
Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be. Strong authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized access.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Implement password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
  - Use secure session tokens (e.g., JWT).

### Authorization
Authorization determines what resources a user can access.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Enforce role-based or attribute-based access control.
  - Prevent privilege escalation attacks.

## üõ° Input Validation and Sanitization

Improper handling of user inputs can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- **Key Measures:**
  - Validate input length, type, and format.
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
  - Sanitize inputs to strip malicious code.

---

## üîí Secure Data Transmission

Protect sensitive data during transmission using encryption protocols.

- **Key Measures:**
  - Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.2/1.3.
  - Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
  - Implement secure cookie attributes (e.g., `Secure`, `HttpOnly`).

---

## ‚è≥ Session Management

Secure session management ensures that user sessions are properly handled and protected from hijacking.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use unique, random session IDs.
  - Regenerate session IDs after authentication.
  - Implement session timeout and logout mechanisms.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling and Logging

Improper error handling can expose sensitive information to attackers.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Avoid displaying stack traces or error messages to users.
  - Use centralized logging with tools like ELK Stack or Splunk.
  - Monitor logs for unusual activity.

---

## üåê API Security

APIs are critical components of modern web applications and must be secured.

- **Key Measures:**
  - Use secure API gateways.
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - Authenticate API calls using API keys or OAuth 2.0.
  - Validate and sanitize input.

---

## üõ° Security Headers

Security headers add an additional layer of protection for web applications.

- **Recommended Headers:**
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP): Prevent XSS attacks.
  - `X-Frame-Options`: Mitigate clickjacking attacks.
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforce HTTPS.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME type sniffing.

---

## üß™ Security Testing

Regular security testing helps identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

- **Types of Testing:**
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Penetration Testing
  - Bug Bounty Programs
