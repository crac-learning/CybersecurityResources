## Can you share examples of techniques to solve cryptography challenges?

Below are the technical details along with commands used on Kali Linux for solving each of the mentioned cryptography challenges, along with a sample example where applicable:

### Brute Force AES Cipher Decryption using Weak Password
- **Technical Details**: Brute forcing involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found. For AES encryption with a weak password, you can try different combinations until the plaintext is revealed.
- **Commands on Kali**:
  - Using **John the Ripper**: `john --format=aes /path/to/encrypted_file`
  - Using **Hydra**: `hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> <target_address> aes-256-cbc`
    - **Example**: `hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 192.168.1.100 aes-256-cbc`
- **CyberChef Usage**: Use the "AES Decrypt" operation with various passwords until the plaintext is obtained.
- **Target**: Defhawk CTF Sweet-16

### XOR Decoding
- **Technical Details**: XOR decoding involves XORing the ciphertext with a key to retrieve the plaintext.
- **Commands on Kali**:
  - Using **XOR analysis tools**: `xorsearch -f /path/to/ciphertext -o /path/to/outputfile`
- **CyberChef Usage**: Use the "XOR Brute Force" operation with different keys to decode the ciphertext.

### Caesar Cipher Decoding
- **Technical Details**: The Caesar cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Commands on Kali**: 
  - Using **Python scripts or tools**: `echo "ciphertext" | caesar -d -p shift_number`
- **CyberChef Usage**: Use the "Caesar cipher" operation with different shift values to decode the ciphertext.

### Hill Cipher Decoding
- **Technical Details**: Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It uses a matrix key to encrypt and decrypt text.
- **Commands on Kali**: Use Python libraries for linear algebra.
- **CyberChef Usage**: Use the "Hill cipher" operation with the correct key matrix to decode the ciphertext.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    
    # Define the key matrix
    key = np.array([[6, 24, 1], [13, 16, 10], [20, 17, 15]])
    
    # Define the ciphertext matrix
    ciphertext = np.array([[35], [24], [13]])
    
    # Calculate the inverse of the key matrix
    key_inv = np.linalg.inv(key)
    
    # Decrypt the ciphertext
    plaintext = np.dot(key_inv, ciphertext) % 26
    print(plaintext)
    ```

### Diffie-Hellman Decoding
- **Technical Details**: Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
- **Commands on Kali**: No specific commands for decoding, as Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol rather than a cipher.
- **Target**: Defhawk CTF Hellway

### Vigenère Cipher
- **Technical Details**: The Vigenère cipher encrypts alphabetic text using a keyword and a cyclic encryption process.
- **Commands on Kali**:
  - Using **Python scripts**: `python vigenere.py -d ciphertext keyword`
