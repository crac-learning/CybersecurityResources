# Thick Client VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)

## Overview

This repository contains documentation and methodologies used in the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) of a **Thick Client Application**. The goal of this engagement is to identify security flaws in the thick client software, assess the risk levels, and provide actionable recommendations for remediation.

---

## Scope

**In-Scope Assets:**
- Thick client application: `<Application Name>`
- Backend servers (as used by the thick client)
- Local data storage used by the client
- Authentication and session management mechanisms

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Web or mobile versions of the application
- Infrastructure unrelated to thick client communication

---

## Tools Used

| Category         | Tool/Utility               |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Traffic Interception | Burp Suite, Fiddler, Wireshark |
| Decompilation & Debugging | dnSpy, Ghidra, IDA Free, x64dbg |
| Scripting | Python, PowerShell |
| File & Memory Analysis | Procmon, Process Hacker |
| Authentication Testing | Mimikatz, Pass-the-Hash tools |
| Static Analysis | .NET Reflector, ILSpy, PEStudio |

---

##  Testing Methodology

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Identify technologies used (e.g., .NET, Java, Delphi)
   - Analyze installation files and dependencies
   - Understand client-server communication

2. **Static Analysis**
   - Reverse engineer the binary for hardcoded credentials, API keys, or logic flaws
   - Analyze strings, method calls, and DLL imports

3. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Monitor process behavior and runtime exceptions
   - Intercept and modify client-server traffic
   - Tamper with application logic and inputs

4. **Authentication & Session Testing**
   - Test login bypass and privilege escalation
   - Replay or manipulate authentication tokens

5. **Local Storage Analysis**
   - Check for sensitive data in logs, registry, or config files
   - Analyze encryption/hashing mechanisms

6. **Exploit Development (if applicable)**
   - Craft Proof-of-Concepts for validated vulnerabilities

## Sample Findings (Redacted)

| ID | Title | Severity | Description |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| 001 | Hardcoded Credentials | High | Credentials found in binary during reverse engineering. |
| 002 | Insecure Local Storage | Medium | Sensitive data stored in plaintext on disk. |
| 003 | Unencrypted Communication | High | Data transmitted in cleartext over HTTP. |

## Reporting

The final report includes:
- Executive summary
- Technical findings with CVSS scores
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC) screenshots
- Recommendations for mitigation

---

## Recommendations

- Use secure coding practices
- Implement certificate pinning
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Apply secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, token rotation)
- Regularly update third-party libraries
