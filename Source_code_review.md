## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Secure Code Reviews

1. **Understand the Application**
   - Familiarize yourself with the application‚Äôs architecture, technologies, and flow.

2. **Automate Where Possible**
   - Use tools to automate scanning for common vulnerabilities (e.g., static analysis tools).

3. **Focus on High-Risk Areas**
   - Review authentication, authorization, input validation, and data handling code thoroughly.

4. **Review Dependencies**
   - Ensure third-party libraries and packages are up to date and secure.

5. **Collaborate Effectively**
   - Encourage team discussions and feedback during reviews to gain multiple perspectives.

6. **Use Checklists**
   - Follow checklists like the one in [Secure Code Review Checklist](https://github.com/mgreiler/secure-code-review-checklist) to ensure thoroughness.
